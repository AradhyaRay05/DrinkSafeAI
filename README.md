# DrinkSafeAI - AI powered water safety predictor

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose  
DrinkSafeAI is designed to predict the **potability of water** using **machine learning and deep learning models**. It provides a user-friendly interface to input water quality parameters and instantly predicts whether the water is safe to drink. The goal of this project is to combine **data-driven insights** with a simple and interactive deployment platform.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview  
The project leverages **real-world water quality datasets** to train and evaluate AI models. It uses a Streamlit-based web app for deployment, enabling real-time predictions. By integrating preprocessing, model training, and a deployed interface, DrinkSafeAI demonstrates how AI can assist in solving environmental and health-related problems.
