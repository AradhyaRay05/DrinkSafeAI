# DrinkSafeAI - AI powered water safety predictor

---

## 🔍 Project Goal
DrinkSafeAI is designed to predict the **potability of water** using **machine learning and deep learning models**. It provides a user-friendly interface to input water quality parameters and instantly predicts whether the water is safe to drink. The goal of this project is to combine **data-driven insights** with a simple and interactive deployment platform.

---

## 📖 Overview  
The project leverages **real-world water quality datasets** to train and evaluate AI models. It uses a Streamlit-based web app for deployment, enabling real-time predictions. By integrating preprocessing, model training, and a deployed interface, DrinkSafeAI demonstrates how AI can assist in solving environmental and health-related problems.

🔄 **Project Workflow**

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & EDA**
- **Data Inspection:** Loaded the dataset with Pandas for an initial inspection of its structure and types.  
- **EDA & Visualization:** Visualized feature distributions and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Filled null values for `ph`, `Sulfate`, and `Trihalomethanes` using the mean.  
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalized the feature set using `StandardScaler` to standardize the data range.  
- **Train-Test Split:** Divided the processed data into training and testing sets for model validation.

### **2️⃣ Model Building**
Extensively tested and compared a wide range of models to find the best performer:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- AdaBoost  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost  
- LightGBM  
- CatBoost  
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras was chosen as the final model for deployment.  

---

### **3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy** was used as the key metric to evaluate and compare the performance of each model.  

---

### **4️⃣ Deployment**
- Built a **user-friendly web application** using Streamlit.  
- Integrated the **best-performing CNN model** (`model.keras`) and the corresponding **scaler** (`scaler.pkl`) for live predictions.
